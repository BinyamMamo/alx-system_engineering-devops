## Introduction
This project focuses on the implementation of HTTPS SSL to secure website traffic, ensuring data integrity and encryption between the client and the server. 

## Tasks

| Task | Files | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0. World wide web | [0-world_wide_web](./0-world_wide_web) | configures a domain zone to redirect to a web server. |
| 1. HAproxy SSL termination | [1-haproxy_ssl_termination](./1-haproxy_ssl_termination) | sets up HAproxy to handle SSL termination. |
| 2. No loophole in your website traffic | [100-redirect_http_to_https](./100-redirect_http_to_https) | redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS to close any security loopholes. |


By taking actions similar to the above, we can ensure that our web infrastructure is robust against traffic snooping and data tampering, providing a secure browsing experience for users.
