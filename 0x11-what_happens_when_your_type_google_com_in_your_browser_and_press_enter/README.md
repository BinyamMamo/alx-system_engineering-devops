# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

Let's imagine you're stepping into a high-tech, bustling hotel, and you're about to order a special dish called "google.com". Here's how your order would be served:

## Placing the Order: Communication and Transmission

**1. Domain Name System (DNS):** This is like the hotel's concierge who knows every room's number. When you ask for "Google's room," the DNS provides your computer with the IP address or the exact "room number" of Google's servers.

**2. TCP/IP:** Once your computer knows where to send the requests, the TCP/IP protocol comes into play. It's like the hotel's internal phone system, ensuring that your requests (data packets) reach the right room (server) and responses are delivered back to you.

**3. Firewall:** This is the hotel's security, ensuring only authorized guests (data packets) are allowed in and keeping out any unwanted visitors (malicious connections).

**4. HTTPS/SSL:** This is the coded language you use to place your order. It ensures your conversation (data transmission) remains private and secure.

## Preparing the Dish: The Server-side Processes

**1. Load Balancer:** This is the hotel manager, efficiently distributing tasks among the staff (servers) to handle the huge customer traffic, ensuring no single staff member is overwhelmed.

**2. Web Server:** This is the waiter who takes your order (web request) and brings you what you asked for (webpage data).

**3. Application Server:** This is the chef who takes the raw ingredients (data) and turns them into a delicious meal (well-formatted information) according to your preferences.

**4. Database:** This is the hotel's pantry, where all the raw ingredients (data) are stored and ready to be used by the chef (application server).

## Serving the Dish: The Magic of the Browser

Finally, the encrypted data arrives at your computer. Your browser is like the plate that presents the chef's creation (webpage) in an appealing and digestible format, parsing the HTML and CSS data and executing the PHP commands.

And there you have it! A flavorful journey of how the internet serves up your request when you type google.com into your browser and press Enter.

Here's a diagram that illustrates the processes described above.
