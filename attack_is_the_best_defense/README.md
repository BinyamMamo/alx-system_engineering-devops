Welcome to "Attack is the Best Defense," a project that delves into the proactive side of cybersecurity. By understanding offensive techniques, we can better defend our systems. This project explores the concepts of network security and penetration testing. It focuses on two main tasks: ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic, and performing a dictionary attack.

## Tasks

| Task | Files | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0. ARP Spoofing and Sniffing Unencrypted Traffic | [0-sniffing](./0-sniffing) | Explore ARP spoofing methods and sniff network traffic to uncover vulnerabilities. |
| 1. Dictionary Attack | [1-dictionary_attack](./1-dictionary_attack) | Implement a dictionary attack to test the strength of passwords used in authentication. |

In conclusion, this project emphasizes the importance of offensive security strategies to reinforce our defenses. By mastering these tasks, we enhance our ability to protect against real-world threats.
